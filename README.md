MERN Application with Docker, Git, and CI/CD Integration
1] MERN Application Development:
Developed a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend, connecting to a MongoDB database.

2] Docker Setup:
Used Docker to containerize the application, with separate containers for the frontend (React), backend (Node.js), and MongoDB.
Docker Compose was configured to manage multi-container environments, and volumes were set up for persistent data storage.

3] Version Control with Git:
Managed the project using Git for version control. Created a repository, made commits, and pushed the code to GitHub.
Followed GitFlow/feature branching strategy for clean code collaboration. Resolved merge conflicts using Git commands.

4] CI/CD Integration:
Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment. Each push triggered automated tests and Docker image builds, ensuring continuous integration and delivery of the Node.js application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
